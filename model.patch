+          comment: "Comprehensive UI/UX testing completed successfully. Flow works end-to-end from NFC tag scan to passport creation to check-in completion. Key findings: Professional construction-focused design with clear visual hierarchy, appropriate mobile sizing, fast responsive interactions. Current color scheme (navy/orange) differs from requested blue/green but provides good contrast and authority feel. Touch targets meet minimum requirements but could be larger for heavy gloves. Success screen provides satisfying completion feedback with clear confirmation of accomplished tasks. Overall delivers professional 'built for workers' experience with clean, functional interface appropriate for job site use."

+      message: "Completed comprehensive UI/UX evaluation of NFC Worker Passport check-in flow. Tested complete user journey from /nfc?tag=DEMO-NFC-001 through passport creation form to success screen. Flow works perfectly with good professional construction aesthetic. Main recommendation: Consider shifting from current navy/orange color scheme to requested deep blue/bright green scheme to fully align with design vision. All core functionality working smoothly with appropriate mobile responsiveness and touch targets."
